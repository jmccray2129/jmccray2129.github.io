			<h1>Hello, I'm Julie!</h1>
				<p>Here's a little bit about me. Honestly, it took me some extra time to get into web development. I've always been creative but like many others I was under the impression that computer programming and languages weren't for people like me. (Gasp!) However I've always been great with computers and love the internet. I built a Wordpress site a long time ago before I knew what I was doing and that I could build a career around helping others perfect their online presence. After some studying and networking with other women that also 'finally' knew what they wanted to do when they 'grew up' I realized that I could give this ago and computer programming didn't require a Computer Science degree or painful hours learning new languages. Instead, it's more about the willingness to continually learn new things and not be afraid to think outside the box. If you've read this far, just know I'm really am glad to have found my passion in a roundabout way.</p>
				<p> Oh, and when I'm not coding, I love to dork out with my boyfriend playing on the Xbox One (Farcry 4, Diablo 3, and other cool shooter types). I love vacations. I love sweets! I love anything DIY (jewelrymaking, scrapbooking, etc). I'm the mom of a cool Minecraft fiend, Bianca (8 going on 36). We have a loving home for a pitbull pup named Luna. We're dorks and we know it .... ain't too proud to show it.</p> 
				<p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio! I welcome the opportunity to bring my skills to your organization to help you reach your goals in big ways!</p>
